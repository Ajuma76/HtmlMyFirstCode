<p>Mercedes-Benz (German: [mɛɐ̯ˈtseːdəsˌbɛnts, -dɛs-]),[6][7] commonly referred to as Mercedes, is a German automotive luxury brand (and subsidiary – as Mercedes-Benz AG
  – of Daimler AG) headquartered in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.[1] Mercedes-Benz produces luxury vehicles and commercial vehicles.[note 2] The first Mercedes-Benz
  brand name vehicles were produced in 1926. In 2018, Mercedes-Benz was the largest seller of premium vehicles in the world, having sold 2.31 million passenger cars.[8]
  The company's origins come from Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft's 1901 Mercedes and Karl Benz's 1886 Benz Patent-Motorwagen, which is widely regarded as the first internal combustion engine in a self-propelled automobile. The fuel was not gasoline, but rather a much more volatile petroleum spirit called ligroin. The slogan for the brand is "the best or nothing".[9]</p>
